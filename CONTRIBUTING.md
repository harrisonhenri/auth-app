# CONTRIBUTING

## Patterns

### Folder naming

The folders containing components should be named using Pascal case. The other folders should be named using the kebab case pattern.

### File naming

The files should be named using the kebab case pattern.

### Import/export

It's recommended to used named exports.

### Components

It's recommended:

- To write functional components (using const)
- To isolate side effects in hooks

### Styles

It's recommended to use the BEM pattern.

## Hypothesis

This project was built [dummy json](https://dummyjson.com/) as a backend follow the hypotheses below:

- This api does not have a refreshToken (and it seems the token is not validated), so, [this snippet](https://github.com/harrisonhenri/auth-app/blob/master/src/services/http/axios.ts#L39) tries to simulate that
- It seems that this api does not return the users data based on the token, so, the app gets the user's data with a get http request using the id as route parameter [as shown here](https://github.com/harrisonhenri/auth-app/blob/master/src/features/slices/user-info/user-info.api.ts#L8). Ideally, this query wouldn't be necessary (the api could already return the entire user's profile on sign in) or done only using the user's session (without the id).

### Git patterns
